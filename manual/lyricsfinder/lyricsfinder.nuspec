    <summary>Automatically search and add lyrics to tracks in your music collection</summary>
    <description>MediaHuman Lyrics Finder is a free software application, which can help you find and add missing lyrics (song text) to all songs in your music library. It's a safe operation because the app doesn't overwrite lyrics you've already had.

Very easy to use: simply drag and drop some tracks from your favorite music player (e.g. iTunes) and MediaHuman Lyrics Finder will do the rest.

MediaHuman Lyrics Finder will give you access to over a million different lyrics collected from various sources on the Internet.</description>
